<b>About the Project</b>

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This project is created for the purpose of learning and gaining a basic understanding of how the MERN stack works together. 
The app allows users to perform the following actions:

Create new users</br>
Read a list of users</br>
Update existing users</br>
Delete users</br>

Backend development is also handled in this crud application including routing, database interactions, form handling, and state management in React.
