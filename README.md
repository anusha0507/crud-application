This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This project is created for the purpose of learning and gaining a basic understanding of how the MERN stack works together. 
The app allows users to perform the following actions:

-> Create new users
-> Read a list of users
->Update existing users
-> Delete users

Backend development is also handled in this crud application including routing, database interactions, form handling, and state management in React.
